# Master's Thesis Research
This is a repository used for the development of my thesis.

The majority of this code will be notebooks documenting the development of the process. The notebooks will include text on the thought process and the mathematical reasoning behind the code.

## Folders

### Libraries
This is a folder that contains a majority of the MATLAB function files and the Julia methods module used in some of the development of the data analysis. Important functions and methods are the signal creation functions, cross-correlation functions, and the SNR calculators. These were used to speed up and simplify the simulations processes. Many of the Julia functions are built upon the .m functions.

### Mat Notebooks
This is a folder that contains all the Matlab notebooks as .mlx live script files. These are important as alot of the development was done in these files. They are ordered in notebook format were N0 was Notebook 0, and was the first notebook created, and N8 was notebook 8 and the eigth one created, and so on. A lot of the thought process was documented in these, it is suggested to open them and read through these if you are trying to understand the thesis work. 

### Pluto Notebooks
This is a folder containing all Pluto notebooks for the data analysis done in Julia. These notebooks were used when Matlab was insufficient. There is a significant amount of text explaining work within these as well. 

## Files

### Thesis Research.bib
This is a bibtex file that was used in the writing of the thesis research paper. It includes all references used in the paper.
