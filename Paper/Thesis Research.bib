	abstract = {Prediction of wireless channel scenarios is fundamental for modern wireless communication systems with diverse propagation conditions. Moreover, the type of data extracted from a wireless communication channel impulse response (CIR) is complex. In recent research, machine learning (ML) techniques have proven their success in classiﬁcation problems of wireless communication scenarios and provide reasonable results. In this paper, a new enhanced feature selection method is proposed to improve the training model and classiﬁcation performance of the conventional model. This improvement is achieved based on the concept of regularization in which the selection of the best features is considered before training the model under any propagation environment. The adoption of regularization leads to a high Total Explained Variance (TEV) during the process of kernel Principal Component Analysis (k-PCA). As a consequence, two principal features are used instead of three. The proposed model has high generalization ability since it reduces the features dimensionality (computational complexity) and, generally, enhances the ML classiﬁcation performance. Experimental simulation is executed to compare the proposed model and the conventional one in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. The accuracy is increased from 97\% to 99\%, from 96\% to 99\%, from 89\% to 97\% and from 90\% to 98\% for k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), k-Means and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), respectively.

	abstract = {Accurate frequency measurement plays an important role in many industrial and robotic systems. However, different inﬂuences from the application’s environment cause signal noises, which complicate frequency measurement. In rough environments, small signals are intensively disturbed by noises. Thus, even negative Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) are possible in practice. Thus, frequency measuring methods, which can be used for low SNR signals, are in great demand. In previous work, the method of cross-correlation spectrum has been developed as an alternative to Fast Fourier-Transformation or Continuous Wavelet Transformation. It is able to determine the frequencies of a signal under strong noise and is not affected by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. However, in its current version, its creation is computationally very intensive. Thus, its application to real-time operations is limited. In this article, a new way to create the cross-correlation spectrum is presented. It is capable of reducing the calculation time by 89\% without signiﬁcant accuracy loss. In simulations, it achieves an average deviation of less than 0.1\% on sinusoidal signals with an SNR of −14 dB and a signal length of 2000 data points. When applied to “self-mixing”-interferometry signals, the method can reach a normalized root-mean-square error of 0.21\% with the aid of an estimation method and an averaging algorithm. Therefore, further research of the method is recommended.},

First, an effective way is presented to measure the distances from the samples to the OCSVM enclosing surfaces. Then based on this measurement, an optimization objective function for the parameter selection is put forward.

	abstract = {Investigating scale-free (i.e., fractal) functional connectivity in the brain has recently attracted increasing attention. Although numerous methods have been developed to assess the fractal nature of functional coupling, these typically ignore that neurophysiological signals are assemblies of broadband, arrhythmic activities as well as oscillatory activities at characteristic frequencies such as the alpha waves. While contribution of such rhythmic components may bias estimates of fractal connectivity, they are also likely to represent neural activity and coupling emerging from distinct mechanisms. Irregular-resampling auto-spectral analysis (IRASA) was recently introduced as a tool to separate fractal and oscillatory components in the power spectrum of neurophysiological signals by statistically summarizing the power spectra obtained when resampling the original signal by several non-integer factors. Here we introduce multiple-resampling cross-spectral analysis (MRCSA) as an extension of IRASA from the univariate to the bivariate case, namely, to separate the fractal component of the cross-spectrum between two simultaneously recorded neural signals by applying the same principle. MRCSA does not only provide a theoretically unbiased estimate of the fractal cross-spectrum (and thus its spectral exponent) but also allows for computing the proportion of scale-free coupling between brain regions. As a demonstration, we apply MRCSA to human electroencephalographic recordings obtained in a word generation paradigm. We show that the cross-spectral exponent as well as the proportion of fractal coupling increases almost uniformly over the cortex during the rest-task transition, likely reflecting neural desynchronization. Our results indicate that MRCSA can be a valuable tool for scale-free connectivity studies in characterizing various cognitive states, while it also can be generalized to other applications outside the field of neuroscience.},

The cross-terms, an inherent feature of the MWD, play a constructive role in this application. In particular, their presence enhancesthe visibility of a m e t in the WVD image in a unique and significant way. The WVD image provides a common input to a pair of channels, with one channel matched to clutter and the other channel matched to target plus clutter. Each channel consists of a principal components analyzer (for f e a m extraction) followed by a multilayer perceptron classifier.

First, by introducing the kernel trick, the KCC extends the linear crosscorrelation to non-linear space, which is more robust to signal noises and distortions. Second, the connection to the existing works shows that KCC provides a uniﬁed solution for correlation ﬁlters. Third, KCC is applicable to any kernel function and is not limited to circulant structure on training data, thus it is able to predict afﬁne transformations with customized properties. Last, by leveraging the fast Fourier transform (FFT), KCC eliminates direct calculation of kernel vectors, thus achieves better performance yet still with a reasonable computational cost. Comprehensive experiments on visual tracking and human activity recognition using wearable devices demonstrate its robustness, ﬂexibility, and efﬁciency. The source codes of both experiments are released at https://github.com/wang-chen/KCC.},

Nonlinearity included provides higher power output over a wide frequency range. This analysis was carried out by numerical simulation of the proposed mathematical formulation. Thus, the bifurcation diagram and the largest Lyapunov exponents are plotted to investigate the dynamic behavior by ranging the voltage applied to the DC motor. In this way, power harvesting is analyzed for two different dynamic responses: periodic and chaotic behavior. Furthermore, this work exhibits an application of frequency-domain techniques, such as short-time Fourier transform, continuous wavelet transform, synchrosqueezed wavelet transform, and Wigner-Ville distribution methods. These methods are often used to analyze non-stationary signals, allowing the verification of dynamic behavior and power harvesting. Therefore, this paper aims to apply the time-frequency methods, mentioned previously, to analyze the mechanical system response in different behaviors.},

This paper researched on the chaos property of duffing oscillator equation with Melnikov criteria. Through analyzing the intermittent chaos mechanism of Duffing oscillator, it was found that the system output is a intermittent chaotic signal when input frequency deviates the compulsory drive frequency slightly, and the deviation can be estimated by the statistic characteristic of output chaotic signal.

The face recognition problem is formulated as a problem in difference space. which models dissimilarities between two facial images. In difference space we formulate face recognition as a two class problem. The classes are: dissimilarities between faces of the same person. and dissimilarities between faces of different people. By modifying the interpretation of the decision surface generated by SVM. we generated a similarity metric between faces that is learned from examples of differences between faces. The SVM-based algorithm is compared with a principal component analysis (PeA) based algorithm on a difficult set of images from the FEREf database. Performance was measured for both verification and identification scenarios. The identification performance for SVM is 77-78\% versus 54\% for PCA. For verification. the equal error rate is 7\% for SVM and 13\% for PCA.},

We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even inﬁnite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems.

In this study, an adaptive kernel function is designed based on the Gaussian kernel, which is used in SVM. While the sigma parameter is determined as an arbitrary value in the traditional Gaussian kernel, a modiﬁed Gaussian kernel method is used that calculates an adaptive value depending on the input vectors in the proposed kernel function.

However, the performance of 2-D FR systems can be degraded by natural factors such as expressions, illuminations, pose, and aging. Several FR algorithms have been proposed to deal with the resulting appearance variability. However, most of these methods employ features derived in the image or the space domain whereas there are benefits to working in the spatial frequency domain (i.e., the 2-D Fourier transforms of the images). These benefits include shift-invariance, graceful degradation, and closed-form solutions. We discuss the use of spatial frequency domain methods (also known as correlation filters or correlation pattern recognition) for FR and illustrate the advantages. However, correlation filters can be computationally demanding due to the need for computing 2-D Fourier transforms and may not match well for large-scale FR problems such as in the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) phase-II experiments that require the computation of millions of similarity metrics. We will discuss a new method [called the class-dependence feature analysis (CFA)] that reduces the computational complexity of correlation pattern recognition and show the results of applying CFA to the FRGC phase-II data.},

	abstract = {Signal processing can be found in many applications and its primary goal is to provide underlying information on speciﬁc problems for the purpose of decision making. Traditional signal processing approaches assume the stationarity of signals, which in practice is not often satisﬁed. Hence, time or frequency descriptions alone are insufﬁcient to provide comprehensive information about such signals. On the contrary, time–frequency analysis is more suitable for nonstationary signals. Therefore, this paper provides a status report of feature based signal processing in the time–frequency domain through an overview of recent contributions. The feature considered here is energy concentration. The paper provides an analysis of several classes of feature extractors, i.e., time–frequency representations, and feature classiﬁers. The results of the literature review indicate that time–frequency domain signal processing using energy concentration as a feature is a very powerful tool and has been utilized in numerous applications. The expectation is that further research and applications of these algorithms will ﬂourish in the near future.},

The possibility of real-time correlation detection is also explored, as are correlation measurements of waveforms that are transmitted over a short line-of-sight wireless link. With waveforms modiﬁed to precompensate for antenna dispersion, 7 dB correlation contrast between matched and nonmatched waveform pairs is obtained. Our results suggest hardware correlation detection as a possibility for processing of arbitrary waveforms in an Ultra-wideband (UWB) receiver.},

Using a battery-resistor circuit we discuss uncertainty concepts and derive expressions for uncertainty of the mean and sums of uncertainties. Finally, we draw attention to the fact that the interpretation of standard deviation as uncertainty depends on the statistical distribution of the data, while the interpretation of uncertainty of the mean is largely insensitive to such distribution, especially for large samples. If the resistor in the battery-resistor circuit is a resistive loudspeaker, the uncertainty or noise is literally the acoustic power of the sound produced by such noise. In the sound analogy the statistical distribution of the noise is related to its timbre.},

	abstract = {The detection of weak monocycle sinusoidal signals is the abstract problem of the weak transient signal detection in many engineering applications. A low constant false alarm rate is often required on some occasions with serious false alarm consequences, such as the relay protection and the weapon trigger. The weak monocycle sinusoidal signal means a low signalto-noise ratio (SNR), only one sinusoidal period, and an unknown initial phase. The support vector machine (SVM) is applied to detect the weak monocycle sinusoidal signal. The false alarm performance of the built SVM is attractive. The characteristics of the built SVM in white Gaussian noise are as follows. Firstly, the probability of false alarm is 0 and the probability of detection is 1 when the SNR is over −11 dB. Secondly, different unknown initial phases cannot influence the performance. Thirdly, the probability of false alarm is always 0, when the SNR is over −25 dB. Furthermore, the experimental results show that this method is also effective in coloured noise. When the SNR of coloured noise is −0.28 dB, the weak monocycle sinusoidal signal can be detected. When the SNR of coloured noise is over −60 dB, the probability of false alarm is always 0.},

The review begins with a brief description of the foundations and principles of Johnson noise thermometry before outlining the many different techniques and technological breakthroughs that have enabled the application of JNT to high-accuracy, cryogenic, and industrial thermometry. Finally, the future of noise thermometry is considered. As the only purely electronic approach to thermodynamic temperature measurement, Johnson noise thermometry has appeal for metrological applications at temperatures ranging from below 1 K up to 800 K. With the rapid advances in digital technologies, there are also expectations that noise thermometry will become a practical option for some industrial applications reaching temperatures above 2000 K.},

Understanding the conditions under which these groups sometimes coordinate their behavior in space and time, or “school,” is important for understanding their ecology, their effects on the ecosystem, and effective management of their stocks. An automated approach to isolate acoustic aggregations in echosounder data relative to the local background scattering is introduced. Aggregations were then identiﬁed and characterized in a large dataset acquired from an autonomous platform and a research vessel. Fish schools were statistically distinct from other aggregations of ﬁsh, with differences in their geometry, frequency response, scattering intensity, and scattering distribution. The statistical distribution of acoustic scattering from ﬁsh shoals generally followed a Rayleigh distribution as predicted for a randomly organized aggregation of homogenous scatterers. Within ﬁsh schools, however, the distribution was distinct from Rayleigh, showing a consistent pattern with most values at low relative scattering levels followed by a sharp roll-off and long right tail. These differences in distribution provide the ability to remotely observe the polarized, organized behavior that deﬁnes schooling, a difﬁcult to observe response to environmental and internal conditions, which has large implications for our understanding and management of schooling ﬁsh.},
